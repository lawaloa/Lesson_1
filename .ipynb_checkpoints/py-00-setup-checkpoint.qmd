# Setup

Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install polars pandas great-tables
```

To test that the installations were successful, use this:

```{python}
from great_tables import GT, exibble
import polars as pl
import polars.selectors as cs
```

```{python}
GT(exibble)
```

```{python}
exibble_pl = pl.from_pandas(exibble)
```

Examples with Polars selectors:

```{python}
exibble_pl.select(cs.numeric())
```

```{python}
exibble_pl.select(cs.starts_with("date"))
```

```{python}
exibble_pl.select(cs.ends_with("time"))
```
